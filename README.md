# SUPPORT YOUR ARTISTS

As of 2025, Spotify pays an average of $0.005 per stream to the artist. That means that if you give the equivalent of $5 directly to them (like merch, buying cds, or just donating), you can """ethically""" listen to them a total of 1000 times. Of course, nobody thinks spotify payment is fair, so preferably you should give more, but $5 is the bare minimum. Big names prolly don't need those $5 dollars, but it might be _the_ difference between going out of business or not for that indie rock band you like.

# Spotizerr

Music downloader which combines the best of two worlds: Spotify's catalog and Deezer's quality. Search for a track using Spotify search api, click download and, depending on your preferences, it will download directly from Spotify or firstly try to download from Deezer, if it fails, it'll fallback to Spotify.

- Queue stalls: Verify service connectivity
- Audiokey related: Spotify rate limit, let it cooldown about 30 seconds and click retry
- API errors: Ensure your Spotify client ID and client secret are correctly entered

**Log Locations**:
- Application Logs: `docker logs spotizerr` (for main app and Celery workers)
- Individual Task Logs: `./logs/tasks/` (inside the container, maps to your volume)
- Credentials: `./data/creds/`
- Configuration Files: `./data/config/`
- Downloaded Music: `./downloads/`

## Notes

- This app has no way of authentication, if you plan on exposing it, put a security layer on top of it (such as cloudflare tunnel, authelia or just leave it accessible only through a vpn)
- Credentials are stored in plaintext - secure your installation
- Downloaded files retain original metadata
- Service limitations apply based on account types
